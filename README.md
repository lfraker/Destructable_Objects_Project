## Overview

A class project required us to research and implement a variation of an algorithm. Naturally, we went with something related to gaming. We implemented a variation of the algorithm described here (3D Voronoi Subdivision Tree for granular materials)[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7395194] to simulate realtime decomposition and shattering of 3D meshes.

## Setup

The project is built in C++ on the Qt framework. To run it, you'll need to install Qt Creator 8.0.1 and Qt framework version 6.3.1 (install Qt and Qt Creator)[https://www.qt.io/download]. The project has been tested on mac, but should run on Windows as well.
